            <h4>Who is Steve Wozniak?</h4>
            <p>
                Steve Wozniak is an American computer scientist, inventor and programmer. In partnership with his friend
                Steve Jobs, Wozniak invented the Apple I computer. The pair founded Apple Computers in 1976 with Ronald
                Wayne, releasing some of the first personal computers on the market. Wozniak also personally developed
                the next model, Apple II, which established Apple as a major player in microcomputing.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1969, Wozniak returned to the San Francisco Bay Area after being expelled from the University of
                Colorado Boulder in his first year for hacking the university's computer system and sending prank
                messages on it. He re-enrolled at De Anza College in Cupertino before transferring to the
                University of California, Berkeley, in 1971. In June 1971, as a self-taught project, Wozniak
                designed and built his first computer with his friend Bill Fernandez. Predating useful
                microprocessors, screens, and keyboards, and using a punch card and only 20 TTL chips donated by an
                acquaintance, they named it "Cream Soda" after their favorite beverage. A newspaper reporter stepped on
                the power supply cable and blew up the computer, but it served Wozniak as "a good prelude to my thinking
                5 years later with the Apple I and Apple II computers". Before focusing his attention on Apple, he
                was employed at Hewlett-Packard (HP), where he designed calculators. It was during this time that he
                dropped out of UC Berkeley and befriended Steve Jobs.

                        Working out of a family garage, he and Jobs attempted to produce a user-friendly alternative to
                        the computers
                        that were being introduced by International Business Machines at that time.
                        As other talented engineers joined the growing company, he no longer believed he was needed
                        there, and by early 1985, Wozniak left Apple again, stating that the company had "been going in
                        the wrong direction for the last five years". He then sold most of his stock.
